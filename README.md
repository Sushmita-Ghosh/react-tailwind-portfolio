Welcome to my portfolio website project, crafted with the power of React and the styling grace of Tailwind CSS! Utilizing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for an incredibly fast build time, this application is deployed and shining on Vercel.

## Overview 🌟

This project encapsulates my journey and projects in a beautiful, responsive design. Tailwind CSS brings utility-first styling into play, making the website not just mobile-friendly but also a visual treat.
Thanks to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) for the super-fast build tooling, this app is lightning quick and ready to showcase your projects and skills in the best light. 🚀 The final product is deployed on Vercel for the world to see.

## Technologies Used 🎯:

- `React Js` - For the seamless single-page application experience.
- `Tailwind Css` - For the utility-first styling that makes responsive design a breeze.

## Animation Libraries 🎨:

To add that extra flair to the website, I've incorporated some cool animation libraries:

- `react-simple-typewriter` - To bring dynamic, typewriter-like effects to text.
- `react-fast-marquee` - To create sleek, horizontal scrolling effects.
